    "\n",
    "Data Science is not just about writing code or plotting graphs. It is the art of extracting **\"Value\"**, **\"Meaning\"**, and **\"Future Predictions\"** from raw data by blending Statistics, Mathematics, and Software skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Engineering Vision (Real-World Examples):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Civil Engineering:**\n",
    "    *   **Scenario:** We have mixture ratios and strength test results for concrete poured over the last 10 years.\n",
    "    *   **Goal:** To predict the strength of a new mixture with 95% accuracy without going to the laboratory.\n",
    "*   **Industrial/Mechanical Engineering:**\n",
    "    *   **Scenario:** Monitoring real-time vibration data of motors in a factory.\n",
    "    *   **Goal:** To issue a warning *\"Bearing failure approaching, perform maintenance\"* 2 days before the machine breaks down (**Predictive Maintenance**).\n",

    "**Concept Confusion (The Matryoshka Model):**\n",
    "These concepts are often confused but are actually nested within each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**\n",
    "    *   *The Big Umbrella.* Any system or technology that mimics human cognitive abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n",
    "2.  **Machine Learning (ML):**\n",
    "    *   *Sub-branch of AI.* Systems where computers learn rules and patterns on their own by looking at data, without being explicitly programmed. (Main focus of our course).\n",
    "3.  **Deep Learning (DL):**\n",
    "    *   *Sub-branch of ML.* Runs on \"Artificial Neural Networks\" that mimic the human brain.\n",
    "    *   *Key Difference:* While features are provided by humans in ML, DL extracts these features automatically from data (image, sound, text) thanks to its complex network structure. (e.g., ChatGPT, Image Processing).\n",
    "4.  **Data Science (DS):**\n",
    "    *   *Intersecting Discipline.* It is the discipline that intersects with all these sets (AI, ML, DL) but independently involves cleaning, analyzing, visualizing raw data, and converting insights into business decisions.\n",
